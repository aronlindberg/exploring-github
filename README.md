exploring github
================
We are a team of researchers at Case Western, Temple, University of Georgia, and Brigham Young, working to create knowledge around digitalized design processes. We believe that open source software development represents an important area, in which there is much to learn.

Using sequence analysis tools borrowed from genetics, we analyze the structure of activities in different repositories, as they unfold across time. Thus, we can help to create knowledge around questions such as:

* What is the evolution of a project's activities?
* What types of processes leads to successful projects?
* How are successful open source software communities built?

We are also keen to learn what the open source community is interested in. You can either get in touch with us over (email)[mailto:aron.lindberg@case.edu] or simply fork the readme.md file in this repo, and submit a pul request with your ideas.

Some ideas are:

* What makes a kick-ass GitHub project?
* Add your idea here.
* â€¦
